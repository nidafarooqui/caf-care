## What to Expect

There are two parts to the medical examination: an interview and the physical examination. The total examination should take about 30 minutes.

### The Interview

At the interview the doctor will discuss your medical history and any current medical conditions that may interfere with safe driving. You are expected to be honest during the discussion. Do not be prevented from applying due to minor medical conditions. You just need to be in reasonable good health to apply. Take the driver medical and see how you do.

You will be asked about the following at the interview:

- Neurological issues (seizures, strokes, blackouts, narcolepsy, brain tumout etc.)
- Diabetes
- Mental health (depression, dementia, psychosis, substance abuse etc.)
- Heart conditions (heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, circulation etc.)
- General helth (drinking, smoking, sleeping disorders etc)
- Current medication

### The Physical Examination

The doctor will check the following:

- Blood pressure
- Eyesight

You may need to undergo further tests depending on your health.

Once the tests are complete, you will receive the signed medical form.
